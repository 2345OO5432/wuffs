# CRC32

Crc32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check 32) is a checksum algorithm that hashes byte
sequences to 32 bit values.

The algorithm is based on polynomial division. In theory, a variety of
polynomials can be used. In practice, only two are widely used. The IEEE
polynomial is used by Bzip2, Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Gzip, MPEG-2, PNG, SATA,
Zip and other formats. The Castagnoli polynomial is used by Btrfs, Ext4, iSCSI,
SCTP and other formats.

TODO: a worked example.
