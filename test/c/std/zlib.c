This test program is typically run indirectly, by the "wuffs test" or "wuffs
bench" commands. These commands take an optional "-mimic" flag to check that
Wuffs' output mimics (i.e. exactly matches) other libraries' output, such as
giflib for GIF, libpng for PNG, etc.

To manually run this test:

for cc in clang gcc; do
  $cc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror zlib.c && ./a.out
  rm -f a.out
done

Each edition should print "PASS", amongst other information, and exit(0).

Add the "wuffs mimic cflags" (everything after the colon below) to the C
compiler flags (after the .c file) to run the mimic tests.

To manually run the benchmarks, replace "-Wall -Werror" with "-O3" and replace
the first "./a.out" with "./a.out -bench". Combine these changes with the
"wuffs mimic cflags" to run the mimic benchmarks.
